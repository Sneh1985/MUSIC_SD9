<h1>Fix Mouse Click Not Working in Strongest Battleground</h1>

<p>If your left mouse click (M1) is not working in Strongest Battleground in Roblox, you are not alone. Many players face this issue, especially when playing on emulator or low-end PC setups. This guide will show you step-by-step solutions that actually work.</p>

<h2>1. Restart Roblox Completely</h2>
<p>Close Roblox fully. Make sure it is not running in Task Manager. Then reopen the game and test again.</p>

<h2>2. Check Mouse Hardware</h2>
<p>Try your mouse in another game or website. If it does not work anywhere, the issue might be your mouse itself. Try another USB port or another mouse.</p>

<h2>3. Enable Smart Controls (If Using Emulator)</h2>
<p>If you are playing Roblox using an emulator like Bluestacks, make sure Smart Controls are enabled. Sometimes the emulator blocks left-click combat controls.</p>

<h2>4. Change In-Game Settings</h2>
<p>Go to Roblox settings and reset your controls. You can also lower graphics settings to reduce lag, which sometimes causes input delay.</p>

<h2>5. Run Roblox as Administrator</h2>
<p>Right click on Roblox Player and choose “Run as Administrator.” This allows proper permission for mouse input.</p>

<h2>6. Reinstall Roblox</h2>
<p>If nothing works, uninstall Roblox completely from Control Panel. Restart your PC and reinstall it from the official Roblox website.</p>

<h2>7. Update Windows and Drivers</h2>
<p>Outdated system drivers can cause input issues. Make sure Windows and your mouse drivers are updated.</p>

<p>After following these steps, your mouse click should work properly in Strongest Battleground. If the problem continues, it may be server-related and you can try joining a different server.</p>
